# OnlineCV

This repository is part of my learning about golang, microservices and containers orchestration. It is a web app which provides an online platform to run opencv. It is built over the tutorial [golang-webapp-tutorial](https://github.com/mfs409/golang-webapp-tutorial) where I used it as a base project to get started.
